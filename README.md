# the Largest Heading An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## The second largest heading Overview of Project
Louise is a budding playwright who is looking to create a crowdfunding campaign for her play, Fever. The estimated budget is over $10,000. In this project I have analysed past crowdfunding data and determined that there are a few specific factors that contribute to a successful funding campaign. 

## The second largest heading Analysis and Challenges
After filtering data to focus on theatre and plays, I used pivot charts and pivot tables to visualise campaign outcomes based on launch date to see if there is a correlation between when a campaign is launched and its success or failure. Screenshots of tables are provided below.

Furthermore, Excel formulas such as COUNTIFS() and SUM() were then to drill down on the Kickstarter data. Here I was able to visualise the percentage of successful, failed, and cancelled projects in the plays subcategory.

One of the biggest challenges in the analysis portion was reconfiguring the COUNTIFS() formula to align with the goal divisions that were in column A. Apart from that minor problem, challenges would have arised had the data not been filtered to focus on plays (prior to analysis). The kickstarter data is quite large, so filtering it down to certain categories and  subcategories makes it easier to work with and produce results that are more relevant to the project at hand. 

## The second largest heading Results 
Through my analysis of the Kickstarter data, I discovered that the best time to launch funding campaigns is in May . The chart (Theatre Outcome vs. Launch) clearly shows that successful campaigns were launched in May, and the success rate trails off by June. Furthermore, this chart also demonstrates that September through December are the last favourable months to launch, with December faring the worst in both failed and successful campaigns.

It appears that campaigns with smaller goal budgets tend to be funded successfully, though there are instances where goals of $35,000 to $45,000 have been met. While there are no cancelled campaigns, indicating that plays are well liked among theatre backers, failed campaigns tend to increase with higher goals. 

There are some limitations in the data set however. First, some plays appear to be in languages other than English. For instance, Los Tradicionales is in Spanish, but it is not noted anywhere. A separate column for language would have gleaned more insight. Lastly, genre of plays might be a valuable piece of information to have, especially when we know that certain genres tend to perform better than others, and perhaps that can be attributed to launch dates or funding goals.
